Anita,

That all makes perfect sense to me. As I said before, the only reason I
spoke up is because I was reading that Web Forms support is being dropped
from all future versions of .NET. Knowing this is the framework that we
depend on, I had to say something. Now I can say that I've done my due
diligence and have absolutely no problem dropping the issue.

So DOD is just one source.

The way directives, policies and instructions work is as follows: 
DOD writes > DA > interrupts and writes their own > AMC interrupts and
writes their own > then ASC interrupts and writes their own.  There is a
whole trail that has to be followed.  This does not include the CIO G6
policies or RMF requirements or STIG requirements.  Then there is the CCB;
which will review and ultimately make a decision on whether their DAA wants
to be responsible for open source to be on their network.  Most of the time
the DAA will refuse to take the risk. 

I appreciate your initiative to look into this, but it goes way deeper than
what DOD may state.  Nothing is ever that easy.  For now we will stand down
on this effort.  

v/r,

Oh here's some more promising sounding ones:


Q: Does the DoD already use open source software?
Yes, extensively. The 2003 MITRE study, "Use of Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense", identified some of many
OSS programs that the DoD is already using, and concluded that OSS "plays a
more critical role in the [Department of Defense (DoD)] than has generally
been recognized".

Intellipedia is implemented using MediaWiki, the open source software
developed to implement Wikipedia. This Open Source Software FAQ was
originally developed on Intellipedia, using a variety of web browsers
including Mozilla Firefox. Thus, this FAQ was developed using open source
software.


Q: Is there an "approved", "recommended" or "Generally Recognized as
Safe/Mature" list of Open Source Software? What programs are already in
widespread use?
No, the DoD does not have an official recommendation for any particular OSS
product or set of products, nor a "Generally Recognized as Safe/Mature"
list.

Here's the link these came from again:

Apparently the DoD has an Open Source Software FAQ:
https://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/

There's a ton of information on there but, very briefly, I did find this:

Q: Isn't using open source software forbidden by DoD Information Assurance
Policy?
No. This misconception comes from a misinterpretation of DoD Instruction
8500.2, "Information Assurance (IA) Implementation", Enclosure 4, control
DCPD-1.

Q: Are "non-commercial software", "freeware", or "shareware" the same thing
as open source software?
No.

That is correct, and .NET 5 is literally .NET Core 4 (just renamed). This is
explained in-depth in the original article link I posted:

I started looking at the .NET CORE and I'm seeing a lot of material stating
this is a free, open source software that is maintained by Microsoft and the
.NET Community on GitHub.  I'm reviewing the DOD IA directives now because
it has always been a security rule within the government that free, open
source software is not allowed on a government network.

Obviously an upgrade of the framework will happen at some point.  With the 
release date so far in the future no definitive decisions can really be made

at this time.  It is quite normal in .Net environments to skip a full
release 
and jump from 4-6, etc.  In fact it is a lot of work without a ton of reward

to stay on the most current build.  Each upgrade has to have a lot of
factors 
considered.

Also, with Microsoft so frequently changing course, releasing newer patterns

then deprecating them, changing architecture has to be a well thought out 
discussion.  .NET CORE originally launched with only MVC support so many 
organizations did not switch over initially.

Mitch here is a great article on the Razor Pages.  There isn't a huge
learning 
curve on these and they have many advantages over the other architecture 
options.  Especially since porting sites over can be done in a lot less
time.

https://www.telerik.com/blogs/razor-pages-the-natural-successor-to-web-forms

Again, support for our current architecture is expected to last for another 
decade so we have time for thoughtful discussion.

That all sounds good to me Mitch. This is the same conversation that I've
been having face-to-face with you for months now. The issue really boils
down to making a decision to update to .NET 5 and beyond (once released) or
stay with .NET Framework 4 indefinitely.

For the record, based on the varying opinions of Mike I've heard so far, he
sounds like a great guy LOL!

The only reason I asked for a firm date is because I got the impression that
this was something we needed to do immediately requiring a rewrite of
applications.  That was my impression the way you were talking to Heidi.
Where you got the Idea I want to stay stagnant I do not know.  I am not
familiar with Razor however so that is something I would have to research
for myself.  Was that a Dig at Jeremy about Mike sitting at his desk LOL.
Just to clarify Jeremy who Heidi was referring to Mike that she LOVED got
fired so definitely heed the advice from Anita about not going directly to
Heidi.  Anyway it seems you both agree a path needs to be taken and that is
fine by me researching new technology and recommending a path forward was
never a strength of mine. I more like to dive deep into whatever path we are
going.

I completely understand you didn't intend to advocate for EF yesterday and
you meant to refer to MVC.  Again, it is a cool technology for less data
intensive sites.  It was actually brought up by another developer before
you, Mike.  I think he even sat at your desk.

I can go ahead and cross that discussion with Mitch off of my to-do list
here since you intended to advocate for MVC instead of EF.

Sure. Entity Framework is definitely a very cool technology but is (and
always has been) entirely optional. There is no urgency for any team to
adopt it or any ORM for that matter. In my opinion, the only way it would be
a good idea is if everyone on the team was advocating for it. But again,
this is entirely off topic as EF was not something we talked about
yesterday.

Yes, I immediately made note of it here in my to-do list to follow up with

architecture.

I don't think they sound that  much alike though.

No I never mentioned Entity Framework and I'm not advocating that we adopt
it for one or any of our sites. I said I think it would be smart to use the
modern and actively supported MVC framework in any new development or
full-blown rewrites, instead of Web Forms. Again, during the conversation
with Heidi, Entity Framework was never mentioned by anyone including myself.

Oh I heard you say if we just adopted Entity Framework on one application it

Entity Framework in a complex data environment like we have so the comment
stuck out.

Danielle,

I agree with your suggestion of adopting Razor, that would be an excellent
solution. The only comments I made to Heidi were concerning Web Forms vs.
the new ASP.NET Core MVC framework (part of .NET Core 3 and .NET >= 5 of
course). Entity Framework was never discussed.

Razor forms will be a quick way to do that if we get to that point.  There
isn't a great cause for immediate concern here, but it's good to have the
information as we plot our future technology path.

Curious how this relates to the Entity Framework conversation you were
having with Heidi?

Again, like we've talked about Mitch, this would require staying
indefinitely on the current version of .NET. Four years from now Microsoft
will be on .NET 8 and we'll still be stuck on .NET Framework 4.

To be clear I'm not suggesting a rewrite of anything. I'm only making the
point that Web Forms support has been dropped from any future .NET releases,
so that will require us to stay on an old, stagnant version.

If we decide to put off updating .NET indefinitely, it is possible at some
point that we may be forced to update it, leaving us with no support for Web
Forms. I feel it would be a good idea to at least be prepared for this
possibility by getting trained up in the modern and actively supported .NET
platform.

Danielle,

Well even the Author of the blog that Jeremy sent said that they will
continue to support the .NET Frame work for a long time.....  So I don't
think even 2029 is the end of support, but it does give a timeline of when
things might need to be looked at to upgrade and for other technologies to
mature so we can choose a path forward that is appropriate.

-All
I attached a link for the latest .Net framework which was released this
year.  I found it strange that .NET framework 3.5 SP1 is supported to
10-10-2028.  I do not believe web forms demise is something going to happen
so fast that we will be left behind.  I am having a hard time finding an
official date so if anyone can find a firm Date not a blog or comments, but
official Microsoft guidance on the demise of .NET Framework which is what
supports our web forms I would appreciate it.  It doesn't hurt to look at
alternatives to using web forms just keep in mind that would require a
rewrite of the applications, and there would be significant costs with that.

So just from what I gather from the tweet web forms support will end in

Still, there are razor forms which are fairly easy to port to in .Net 5.
